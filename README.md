# cmu_2022capstone_Arboretica
This repo is for a NLP project by CMU students and Arboretica  

Our project goal is to develop an algorithm solution for our client, Arboretica, to extract company names and mutual relationships from texts more dynamically. To complete this project, we conducted literature research, explored different natural language processing techniques, expanded our dataset, and fine-tuned an advanced tranformer model(LUKE) tailored to our clientâ€™s needs. Our algorithm is expected to significantly reduce human efforts.
